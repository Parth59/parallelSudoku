Parallelizing a Sudoku SolverKevin Kuan (kkuan)Summary:

I am going to make my own serial and parallel implementation of a Sudoku solver in order to analyze the speedup difference between a serial and parallel implementation of the solver. 
I will be using OpenMP to help me with the parallelization process, as well as use various Gates machines with different processors in order to better analyze the speedups.Background:Sudoku is a classic puzzle where the user must fill in a 9x9 grid with numbers such that each row, column and 3x3 grid will have the numbers 1 through 9 occur only once. 
Some Sudoku puzzles can go beyond 9x9 grids, but my implementation will focus specifically on the 9x9 size. 
All Sudoku puzzles will have some given numbers on them, and the difficulty of the puzzle varies depending on how many numbers are given, as well as the location of the numbers that are given.

Since the main purpose of Sudoku solvers is to quickly permute through all of the possible combinations of numbers that can be selected, my implementation will focus on efficiently searching through all of these possible number configurations. 
In particular, the basic way of solving Sudoku puzzles is to look for specific patterns, and having parallelism can allow the program to search for these patterns much more quickly, as they can be searched in parallel due to the fact that they’re not dependent on each other. Challenge:This problem is challenging because for a standard 9x9 grid Sudoku puzzle, there are 6.671 x 1021 different possible solutions. 
Evidently, even if the player is given around 20 numbers, that still leaves a lot of solutions that need to be permuted in order to find the one correct solution. 
Therefore, it is of the upmost important for my implementation to maximize my CPU usage, as it will be the main area of focus when it comes to getting the fastest solution time.
Communication costs will also be an aspect I need to look at closely, as I definitely anticipate the use of multiple workers/threads to permute different combinations of numbers. 
On the other hand, memory is a concept that I don’t have to worry about since traditional Sudoku boards are not very big, just 81 integers. 
However, I may have to reconsider memory if I choose to try using bigger Sudoku boards (such as 20 by 20 grids, etc.) or use an algorithm that remembers the state of the boards. Resources:I will be starting my code primarily from scratch, with a little bit of starter code from my previous homework assignments involving CUDA. 
I will be using the following website’s proposed algorithm as a starting point for my implementation: https://alitarhini.wordpress.com/2011/04/06/parallel-depth-first-sudoku-solver-algorithm/
I have access to all of the resources I need to use, which are primarily the Gates machines that will be running the algorithm. 
It might also be worthwhile to have access to the Blacklight machines if I want to try to compare the speedups on different processors. Goals:In order to have a successful project, I plan to have both a serial and parallel implementation of a Sudoku solver so that I can compare the speedup differences on different machines. 
If I happen to get ahead of my proposed schedule, I hope I can implement multiple serial/parallel implementations that utilize different algorithms, as well as extend my original serial/parallel implementation to work efficiently on Sudoku boards bigger than 9x9.
The demo I plan to show at the parallelism competition will be my algorithm running on various Sudoku boards. 
This will focus on comparing the computing time of the serial implementation versus that of the parallel implementation on Sudoku boards of varying difficulty. 
I will also present graphs of the speed-up on different machines that ran my algorithm to further emphasize how the parallelism optimized is much more optimal than the serial implementation.Platform ChoiceI am planning on using OpenMP to help implement my algorithm. 
Not only is it the language I am most comfortable using thus far in the course, but it is also useful since I anticipate there will be a fair amount of data sharing, and OpenMP is useful in that regard. 
If there are other implementations of a Sudoku solver that show a lot of promise, I will consider switching languages, especially if I have extra time towards the end of the project and I want to work on a different implementation.	 Schedule:
